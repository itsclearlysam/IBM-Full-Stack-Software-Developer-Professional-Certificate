Definition and Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
-----------------------------------------------------------

Cloud computing, also referred to as “the cloud,” ; 
*is the delivery of on-demand computing resources. Everything from applications to data centers, over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.*


The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST’s) definition of cloud computing:

NIST defines cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network 
access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.



Examples of computing resources include:
---------------------------------------
-networks
-servers, storage
-applications
-services.

This cloud model is composed of:
--------------------------------
- 5 essential characteristics
- 3 deployment models
- 3 service models



5 essential characteristics of the cloud:
-----------------------------------------
-on-demand self-service
-broad network access
-resource pooling
-rapid elasticity
-measured service. 

----------------------------------------

1. ON-DEMAND SELF-SERVICE: 

access to cloud resources such as the processing power,
storage, and network you need, using a simple interface,
without requiring human interaction with each service provider. 


2. BROAD NETWORK ACCESS:
.........................
cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard
mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations. 

3. RESOURCE POOLING:
.........................
what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers,
making cloud cost-efficient. 

4. RAPID ELASTICTIY:
.........................
implies that you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don’t,
because resources are elastically provisioned and released.

5. MEASURED SERVICE:
.........................
means that you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go, if you’re not using resources, you’re not paying. 
 Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.


-------------------------------------------------------------
3 types of cloud deployment models:
.........................
-Public
-Private
-Hybrid.


Public cloud:
.........................
when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the
cloud provider,but its usage is shared by other companies. 


Private cloud:
.........................
means that the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization.
It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.



Mix of both public and private clouds:
.........................
working together seamlessly, that is classified as the Hybrid model.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 service models that are based on the three layers in a computing stack:
Infrastructure, Platform, and Applications


-Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)
-Platform as a Service (PaaS)
-Software as a Service (SaaS).








 A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. A hypervisor also separates the Virtual Machines logically, assigning each its own slice of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage, preventing the virtual machines from interfering with each other. If, for example, one operating system suffers a crash or a security compromise, the others keep working. As technologies and hypervisors improved and were able to share and deliver resources reliably, some companies decided to make the cloud’s benefits accessible to users who didn’t have an abundance of physical servers to create their own cloud computing infrastructure. Since the servers were already online, the process of spinning up a new instance was instantaneous. Users could now order cloud resources they needed from a larger pool of available resources and they could pay for them on a per-use basis, also known as Pay-As-You-Go. This pay-as-you-go or utility computing model, became one of the key drivers behind cloud computing taking off. The pay-per-use model allowed companies and even individual developers to pay for the computing resources as and when they used them, just like units of electricity. This allowed them to switch to a more cash-flow friendly OpEx model from a CapEx model. This model appealed to all sizes of companies, those who had little or no hardware, and even those that had lots of hardware, because now, instead of making huge capital expenditures in hardware, they could pay for compute resources as and when needed. It also allowed them to scale their workloads during usage peaks, and scale down when usage subsided. And this gave rise to modern-day cloud computing. The impact of the evolution of the cloud has been immense. In the next training, we will go over some key considerations for cloud adoption.



Alibaba Cloud, also known as Aliyun, while relatively new, is the largest Chinese cloud computing service provider. Aliyun provides a comprehensive suite of global cloud computing services to power not just their customers’ online businesses but also the Alibaba Group’s own e-commerce ecosystem. It offers a host of products and services such as compute, network, storage, security, monitoring and managing, communication, analytics, IoT, application development, data migration, web hosting, and more. One of the first to enter the cloud computing space, Amazon Web Services, or AWS Cloud, offers an extensive range of Infrastructure and Platform services to individuals, companies, and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. The Amazon Cloud provides a wide range of products, services, and solutions ranging from Compute, DevOps, Data, Analytics, IoT, Machine Learning, Networking, Content Delivery, Robotics, Serverless Computing, and much more. Google Cloud Platform, or GCP, is a suite of cloud computing services, providing Infrastructure, Platform, and Serverless Computing environments. Google also uses GCP internally for their end-user products such as Google Search and YouTube. Google Cloud includes G Suite with products for communication, productivity, collaboration, storage, and more. The Google App Engine is a platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers, automatically allocating and de-allocating resources to handle demand. IBM cloud is a full stack cloud platform that spans public, private, and hybrid environments with products and services covering compute, network, storage, management, security, DevOps, and databases. Some of their prominent offerings include their Bare Metal Servers, VMWare, Cloud Paks for Application Modernization, Virtual Private Cloud, and the suite of emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, Blockchain, Data and Analytics. With the acquisition of Red Hat, IBM is also positioning itself as the leading hybrid cloud provider of our times. Microsoft Azure is a flexible cloud platform for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft managed data centers. With its data centers spread out in many regions, Azure provides a global reach with a local presence. It provides Software, Platform, and Infrastructure services supporting Microsoft-specific and third-party languages, tools, and frameworks. Oracle Cloud is primarily known for Software as a Service and Database as a Service (also known as the Oracle Data Cloud). Oracle’s SaaS offering includes wide-ranging applications such as ERP, SCM, HCM, Marketing, Sales, and CX running in the cloud. And the Oracle Data Cloud provides one of the largest cloud-based data management platforms helping customers personalize their online, offline, and mobile marketing campaigns, for targeted audiences. Oracle Cloud also provides some cloud Infrastructure and Platform services. Salesforce specializes in their Software as a Service offering that focuses on customer relationship management, supporting businesses to better connect with their customers, partners, and potential customers.

SAP is known for Enterprise software and applications such as ERP, CRM, HR, and Finance, running in the cloud. There is also an SAP Cloud Platform for building and extending business applications with rapid innovation cycles in a secure cloud computing environment managed by SAP. In the next video, we’re going to look at the business case for cloud computing.






Lesson 1 Summary: Introduction to Cloud Computing:

        

-Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

-The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

-Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

-Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.
