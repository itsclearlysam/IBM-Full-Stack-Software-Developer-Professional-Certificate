Definition and Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
-----------------------------------------------------------

Cloud computing, also referred to as “the cloud,” ; 
*is the delivery of on-demand computing resources. Everything from applications to data centers, over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.*


The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST’s) definition of cloud computing:

NIST defines cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network 
access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.



Examples of computing resources include:
---------------------------------------
-networks
-servers, storage
-applications
-services.

This cloud model is composed of:
--------------------------------
- 5 essential characteristics
- 3 deployment models
- 3 service models



5 essential characteristics of the cloud:
-----------------------------------------
-on-demand self-service
-broad network access
-resource pooling
-rapid elasticity
-measured service. 

----------------------------------------
1. ON-DEMAND SELF-SERVICE: 

access to cloud resources such as the processing power,
storage, and network you need, using a simple interface,
without requiring human interaction with each service provider. 



2. BROAD NETWORK ACCESS:
cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard
mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations. 

3. RESOURCE POOLINB:
what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers,
making cloud cost-efficient. 

3. RAPID ELASTICTIY:
implies that you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don’t,
because resources are elastically provisioned and released.

6. MEASURED SERVICE:
means that you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go, if you’re not using resources, you’re not paying.
